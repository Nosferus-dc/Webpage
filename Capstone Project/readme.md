Capstone Project:
UFO Sightings in US

Analysed 60K+ UFO sightings in US using Python, identifying hotspots and trends. Built Power BI dashboards to visualize patterns, revealing a sharp increase in documented reports since 1994. Findings suggest correlation with growing media interest and drone adoption.

Final presentation deck includes 3D models hence larger than 50mb size limit for Github
